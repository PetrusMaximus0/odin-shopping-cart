# Shopping Cart

This is a solution for the assignment Shopping Cart, from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart).

## Requirements

The assignment consists of a mock shopping cart. The user should be able to browse items, add and remove them from a cart, and visualize a checkout page.

As the user adds or removes items to the cart, the total amount on the cart adjusts accordingly.

Testing implemented with the React Testing Library, and Mock Service Worker.

Built with React. Uses FakeStore API for fetch requests.
